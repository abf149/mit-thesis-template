% , utilizing simple formulae for \textit{architectural} compute and memory savings from sparse acceleration features (SAFs.) 

Researchers leverage existing fast analytical modeling frameworks such as Sparseloop for design-space exploration of sparse tensor accelerator architectures. Contrary to what one might expect, the energy consumption and area of microarchitecture can become significant when designing a sparse tensor accelerator. 

Systematic design-space exploration of microarchitecture is lacking in prior sparse tensor accelerator research; for example, while Sparseloop models the benefits of exploiting tensor sparsity for improved efficiency, it does not model the energy and area overhead of the microarchitectures that exploit tensor sparsity. Many papers propose unique microarchitectures to exploit sparsity, but there is a lack of consistent abstractions and it is difficult to do apples-to-apples comparison.

This paper presents a general approach to categorizing SAF microarchitectures, through which a number of prior works are synthesized into a concise, unified taxonomy of microarchitectures for the most common SAFs (format, gating and skipping.) Based on this taxonomy, SAFTools is a new software framework that helps researchers describe, model and implement SAF microarchitectures. SAFTools can consume a sparse architecture specification and (1) automatically design microarchiture(s) for all SAF(s) exploited by the architecture, (2) generate analytical models of SAF microarchitecture energy, latency and area, and (3) generate parameterized HDL for the SAF microarchitecture, to support implementation.

Extending an architectural analytical model framework for sparse accelerators with SAFTools-generated analytical models results in an $X\%$ modeling accuracy improvement against architectural modeling only. This work also presents case studies of design insights from SAF microarchitecture design-space exploration, which was previously impractical.
