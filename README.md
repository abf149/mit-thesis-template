# 2023 MIT Thesis Template

A _very_ slight variant on the normal unofficial template in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/mit-thesis-template/ytphktgwpktc), but updated to reflect two changes to the title page formatting as of 2023:

1. Copyright now belongs to the student in all cases, with a mandatory permission statement granting MIT a license.
2. Signature lines are no longer required since thesis submission is electronic; instead, the MIT libraries page 

I attempted to follow the guidelines on the [MIT libraries formatting guide](https://libraries.mit.edu/distinctive-collections/thesis-specs/#owner) but may have made a mistake. In particular, I had to shrink some text sizes to make things fit nicely with the new requirements. It doesn't say that this is not allowed, but I'm not sure.

In any case, I take no responsibility for the accuracy of this template. Please verify that your thesis adheres to the MIT libraries guidelines.

Happy writing!
